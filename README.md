# Caesar Cipher – Python Implementation

This is a beginner-level implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption algorithm using Python.

## 🔐 About the Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

This script allows:
- **Encryption** of words or sentences by shifting letters by a user-defined key
- **Decryption** of previously encrypted messages using the same key

Non-alphabet characters like spaces and punctuation are preserved as-is.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts both single words and full sentences
- Handles non-alphabet characters
- User-friendly loop for repeated use
- Implements both **encryption** and **decryption** functions
- Supports lowercase letters (basic English alphabet)

## 🧠 Example

Do you want to encrypt or decrypt : encrypt
Enter the word you want to encrypt : hello world
enter key number : 3
Your encrypted word is : khoor zruog

Do you want to encrypt or decrypt : decrypt
Enter the word you want to decrypt : khoor zruog
enter key number : 3
Your decrypted word is : hello world

## 📂 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or copy the code.
2. Run the script in any Python 3 environment.
3. Follow the input prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Add uppercase support
- Add input validation for key
- Wrap the code in a command-line interface (CLI)
- Add support for multiple languages
